# Devbox + Turborepo Kitchen-Sink Starter

[![Built with Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/img/devbox/shield_galaxy.svg)](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/contributor-quickstart/)

> This is a port of [vercel/turborepo/examples/kitchen-sink](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/kitchen-sink)
> to [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox).

## Why?

_See [Why Use Devbox?](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/#why-use-devbox)_

- 1 command to run the project
  - `devbox run all`
- 1 command to access the env
  - `devbox shell`
- Import `.env` into the environment
  - ‚ùå Replaces [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)
- TUI for service management & visibility, powered by [process-compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose)
  - ‚ùå Replaces [concurrently](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently) & turborepo's TUI
- Shared, project-specific shell for all contributors
  - üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è No more fighting `$PATH`
- Isolate project dependencies from other projects
  - ‚ùå Replaces [n](https://github.com/tj/n), [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), conflicting package managers, etc.
- Unlike Docker, no slowness from virtualization
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è So you still need to use different ports for apps (e.g. `:3000`, `:3001`)
- Re-use of the same environment in CI
  - If `devbox run lint` works locally, it works in CI üí™
